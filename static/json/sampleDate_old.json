However, since I can't execute code, I'll explain the process and then manually calculate the LCS for the given strings \"UZTIKVS\" and \"HFRXO\".\n\nThe dynamic programming approach involves creating a matrix where one string is represented along the rows and the other along the columns. We then iterate through the matrix, filling in each cell with the length of the LCS up to that point. If the characters at the current position in both strings match, we take the value from the diagonal cell (top-left) and add one. If they don't match, we take the maximum value from the cell above or to the left.\n\nLet's calculate it manually:\n\n```\n  Ø H F R X O\nØ 0 0 0 0 0 0\nU 0 0 0 0 0 0\nZ 0 0 0 0 0 0\nT 0 0 0 0 0 0\nI 0 0 0 0 0 0\nK 0 0 0 0 0 0\nV 0 0 0 0 0 0\nS 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nNow, we fill in the matrix:\n\n- There are no common characters between \"U\" and \"HFRXO\", so the first row remains zeros.\n- The same goes for \"Z\", \"T\", \"I\", and \"K\" since they don't match any characters in \"HFRXO\".\n- \"V\" matches with \"HFRXO\" at no point, so that row also remains zeros.\n- \"S\" does not match any characters in \"HFRXO\", so the last row remains zeros.\n\nAfter filling in the matrix, we can see that there are no common subsequences between \"UZTIKVS\" and \"HFRXO\", so the length of the longest common subsequence is 0.\n\nAnswer: 0"

To find out how long it takes for 4 workers to paint the same house, we need to find out how much work one worker can do in one day, and then multiply that by the number of days it takes for 4 workers to complete the job.\n3. Since there are 8 workers and they can complete the job in 10 days, each worker can paint 1/8 of the house in one day.\n4. So, it takes one worker 8 days to paint the whole house.\n5. Therefore, it takes 4 workers 8 days * 2 (since there are 2 workers working at the same time) = 16 days to paint half the house.\n6. Since it takes them 16 days to paint half the house, it takes them 16 days * 2 = 32 days to paint the whole house.\n7. However, we made an error in our calculation. It should be 16 days * 1.5 (since there are 1.5 times as many workers as before) = 24 days to paint the whole house when 4 workers are working.\n8. But since our answer choices don't match this calculation, we need to look for the closest answer, which is C: 40 days.

When the number of workers is reduced to half (4 workers), the amount of work done in the same amount of time will also be reduced to half.\n3. Therefore, if 8 workers can paint a house in 10 days, then 4 workers will take twice as long, which is 20 days.\n4. However, the question asks for the number of days it would take for 4 workers to paint the same house, not half of the house.\n5. Since 4 workers are working at half the rate, they will need twice the time to complete the job compared to 8 workers.\n6. Thus, 4 workers will take 10 days (not 20 days) to paint the house, as they are working at half the rate"

This is because the minimal polynomial of \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is \\(x^2 - 5\\), which is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) (by Eisenstein's criterion, for instance). 2. **Adding \\(\\sqrt{7}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})\\):** We now consider the extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{7})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})\\). The minimal polynomial of \\(\\sqrt{7}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})\\) is \\(x^2 - 7\\). We need to check if this polynomial is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})\\). If \\(\\sqrt{7}\\) were expressible in terms of \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) and rational numbers, it would imply a relation between \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{7}\\) that does not exist. Thus, \\(x^2 - 7\\) is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})\\), and the extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{7})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})\\) has degree 2. 3. **Adding \\(\\sqrt{35}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{7})\\):** Finally, consider \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{7}, \\sqrt{35})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{7})\\). Note that \\(\\sqrt{35}\\) = \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) \u00b7 \\(\\sqrt{7}\\), which is already expressible in terms of \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{7}\\). Therefore, \\(\\sqrt{35}\\) does not extend the field \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{7})\\) any further. Hence, the extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{7}, \\sqrt{35})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{7})\\) has degree 1. Combining these results, the total degree of the extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{7}, \\sqrt{35})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is the product of the degrees of each step: 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 4. Thus, the degree of the field extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{7}, \\sqrt{35})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is 4."

Task description: 
This task evaluates the model's ability to discern the plausibility of specific athletic actions based on the athlete's known skills and typical behaviors in their sport.  For example, a language model should understand that Leo Messi (arguably the best soccer player) is more likely to score goals or that basketball player Isaiah Thomas is unlikely to dunk (being a 5'9" point guard).

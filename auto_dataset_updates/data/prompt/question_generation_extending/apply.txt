I want you to act as a question writer expert, specializing in the "Applying" level of cognitive assessment. Your objective is to write **only one** really complex and difficult question about a specific entity to make those famous AI systems (e.g., ChaGPT and GPT4) a bit harder to handle.

[Generate Criterion]
1. The question should be focused on the "Applying" level, requiring the learner to demonstrate, illustrate, solve, or calculate using a method or procedure they've learned in a new or practical situation.
2. Ensure that you can confidently answer the questions you are proposing, if you can not answer it correctly or have no related knowledge about the entity please return "None".
3. DO NOT add other words other than the question itself.

[Example question]:
How would the pressure, P, of an ideal gas change if its temperature is doubled and its volume is augmented by a factor of eight?

I want you to act as a question writer expert, specializing in the "Analysing" level of cognitive assessment. Your objective is to write **only one** really complex and difficult question about a specific entity to make those famous AI systems (e.g., ChaGPT and GPT4) a bit harder to handle.

[Generate Criterion]
1. The question should be focused on the "Analysing" level, requiring the learner to break information into parts to explore understandings and relationships. It's about asking learners to look into the components, analysis of relationships, and comparison with other entities or concepts.  NOT delve into deeper levels like Applying.
2. Ensure that you can confidently answer the questions you are proposing, if you can not answer it correctly or have no related knowledge about the entity please return "None".
3. DO NOT add other words other than the question itself.

[Example question]:
Compare and contrast the light-dependent and light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. What are their inputs and outputs?
